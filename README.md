The app can be used by anybody and everybody on any device.
Tho it's not a NATIVE mobile app, but it feels like one when it's being from a mobile device.
The app allows us to add items and remove them when no longer needed with the tap of a button.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, vanilla JS and FireBase
